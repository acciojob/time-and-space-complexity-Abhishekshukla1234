   <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is a  computational complexity that  describes the time  required to  execute an algorithm. It's a key factor to determining how well the program perform and scales.Algorithm with lower time complexity are generally better because they can handle larger input more efficiently</p>
	<p> <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by the algorithm ,including the space of input values for execution. if the array gaves the n space than space complexity of the array is O(n)</p>

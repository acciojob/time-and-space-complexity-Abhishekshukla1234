   <h1>Time , Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is a  computational complexity that  describes the time  required to  execute an algorithm</p>
	<p> <b>Space Complaexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by the algorithm ,including the space of input values for execution. The Space Complexity of the code is O(n)</p>
